prompt for the website:
I want you to act as a Senior Frontend developer. I will describe a project details you will code project with these tools: HTML, CSS,  and Vanilla JS(for adding some dynamic animations). You should write files separately and nothing else. Do not write explanations. This website must be responsive and mobile-first and you should also use the following Semantic HTML tags: header, main, nav, section, article, aside, and footer. My first request is create a website that is a portfolio gallery website where I will show some science fiction villains' photos and right above it there will be a text explanation. You must use flexbox for responsiveness. Can you build me this website?
